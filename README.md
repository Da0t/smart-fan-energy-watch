# smart-fan-energy-watch

## What we’re building
A USB desk fan energy and temperature monitoring system with a simulated “smart control” policy to reduce unnecessary energy usage.

## What we measure
- Energy usage of a USB desk fan using an inline USB power meter (Wh over time).
- Ambient temperature using a temperature sensor (°C over time).

## What we output
A comparison between baseline (fan always on) and smart scenarios (fan on only when needed), including total energy usage, estimated cost, and estimated carbon (CO₂e) impact.
